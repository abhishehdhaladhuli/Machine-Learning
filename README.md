🤖 Machine Learning Projects using Scikit-learn
📋 Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using Python and Scikit-learn.
Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem using core ML techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical applications of supervised and unsupervised learning — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
